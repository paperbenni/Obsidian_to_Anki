# Obsidian Plugin Users

Embedded audio is supported via doing Obsidian's standard `![[embed]]` syntax.

# Python Script Users

Embedded audio is supported if:
1. The audio file is stored locally
2. It is embedded using the syntax `[sound:{path_to_file}]`. So, for example, if the filename was `record.wav` and it was in a `Media` folder, you'd write `[sound:Media/record.wav]`
