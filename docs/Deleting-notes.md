To delete a note, format as following:

<pre>
{Delete Note Line}
{Identifier}
</pre>

For example, for a note with identifier "123456789", and default settings:

<pre>
DELETE
ID: 123456789
</pre>

Ensure that you separate this DELETE block from any other note blocks with a newline/newlines - otherwise, this might be interpreted as simply adding the text "DELETE" to a note in Anki!
