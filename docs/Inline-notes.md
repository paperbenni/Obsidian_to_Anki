Unlike regular 'block' notes, you can put inline notes anywhere on a line - for example, you could have a bulletpointed list of inline notes.  
Also, unlike regular block notes, the script identifies the note type through the string in square brackets. Hence, **note types with \[ or \] in the name are not supported for inline notes.**
