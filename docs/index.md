* **[[Tag formatting]]**, on a *per-note* and *per-file* basis. And for Obsidian plugin users, on a *per-folder* basis too!
* **[[Deck formatting]]** on a *per-file* basis. And for Obsidian plugin users, on a *per-folder* basis too!

* **[[Inline notes]]** - Shorter syntax for typing out notes on a single line.
* **[[Cloze formatting]]** - A more compact syntax to do Cloze text.
* **[[Frozen Fields]]**
* **Skipping over previously scanned and unchanged files** - should be useful for large vaults! See [[Data file]].
* **[[Obsidian Integration]]**
* **[[Regex]]** - Using **regular expressions**, add custom syntax to generate **notes that make sense for you.** Note that **all custom syntax is off by default**, and must be programmed into the script via the config file - see [[Regex]] for instructions.

By default, the script adds to the current profile in Anki - you need to switch profiles in Anki to add to another profile.
