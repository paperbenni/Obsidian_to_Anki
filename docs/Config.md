# DEFAULT section

Section for setting default parameters of the script:
## All users
* Tag - the default tag added to every card produced by this script
* Deck - the default deck every card produced by this script goes into. Overridden by TARGET DECK (see [syntax](#syntax))
* CurlyCloze - explained in [[Cloze-formatting]]
* GUI - allows you to enable/disable the GUI of the script. See [[Command line usage]]
* ID Comments - Toggle whether or not card IDs are wrapped in a HTML comment. Wrapping IDs in a HTML comment makes them invisible on 'preview' mode, which can make notes look cleaner.
* Add file link: Whether you want to append a link to the associated obsidian file.

## Python Script users (Deprecated)
* Anki Path and Anki Profile - Deprecated: previously used to automatically open Anki when running the Python script. This behaviour is no longer supported; prefer the Obsidian plugin's workflow.

Note that 'Add file link' currently only adds to the first field of the card in the script, whereas in the plugin you can configure which field to add the link to.

# Syntax

Note that START, END, TARGET DECK, FILE TAGS and DELETE all require an **exact match** on the line - you cannot have spaces afterwards.
* Begin Note - The string that signals the start of a [note](#note-formatting). Defaults to START.
* End Note - The string that signals the end of a note. Defaults to END.
* Begin Inline Note - The string that signals the start of an [inline note](#inline-note-formatting). Defaults to STARTI (Start-Inline).
* End Inline Note - The string that signals the end of an inline note. Defaults to ENDI (End-Inline).
* Target Deck Line - The string that signals "the line beneath me is the name of the target deck". Defaults to TARGET DECK. Can also use as TARGET DECK: {Deck Name} - see [[Deck-formatting]]
* File Tags Line - The string that signals "the line beneath me is the set of tags that should be added to all notes from this file". Defaults to FILE TAGS. Can also use as FILE TAGS: {Tag List} - see [[Tag-formatting]]
* Delete Note Line - The string that signals "the line beneath me is an id string for a note that should be deleted." Defaults to DELETE.
