# Usage
**[[Regex]] line:** `((?:.+\n)*(?:.*{.*)(?:\n(?:^.{1,3}$|^.{4}(?<!<!--).*))*)`

1. Create a file called `test.md`
2. Paste the following contents into the file:

<pre>
The idea of {cloze paragraph style} is to be able to recognise any paragraphs that contain {cloze deletions}.

The script should ignore paragraphs that have math formatting like $\frac{3}{4}$ but no actual cloze deletions.

With {2:CurlyCloze} enabled, you can also use the {c1|easier cloze formatting},
but of course {{c3::Anki}}'s formatting is always an option.
</pre>
## Obsidian Plugin Users

## Python Script 
3. Run the script, and check '[[Config]]' to open up the config file:  
![GUI](Images/GUI_config.png)
4. Navigate to the "Custom Regexps" section
5. Change the line
<pre>
Cloze =  
</pre>  
to  
`Cloze = (.*{.*\n?)`  

6. Also set `CurlyCloze = True` to have the above example work properly.
7. Save the config file
8. Run the script on the file, with 'Regex' checked:  
![GUI](Images/GUI_regex.png)

## All users

### Highlight-cloze style (Obsidian Plugin only)

**Regex line**: `((?:.+\n)*(?:.*==.*)(?:\n(?:^.{1,3}$|^.{4}(?<!<!--).*))*)`

You can also use markdown highlights instead of curly braces in order to indicate cloze deletions - just use the above style, and also enable 'CurlyCloze - Highlights to Clozes'!
