The deck that cards from this folder should be added into. If blank, then defers to the deck of the parent folder, or to the global default deck if the parent folder is the vault itself.

# Folder tags

A space-separated list of tags to add to any cards from this folder, or any of this folder's subfolders. E.g. `Tag1 Tag2 Tag3` would add the tags `Tag1`, `Tag2`, `Tag3`.
